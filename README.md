# A/B Tester

## Installation

`composer require thoughtco/statamic-ab-tester`

## Usage

This package provides tags that you can use in your Statamic templates:


### Experiment types
There are two types of experiments you can run: 

#### Entry
An Entry experiment lets you select an entry and display it on the page. This can be selectd from any collection and will be available as an `entry` variable inside the `ab` tag.

#### Manual
A Manual experiment lets you determine what you want to do inside the experiment, e.g. show a different nav UI, show a different button style. You can use the autogenerated `variant:id` or use `variant:label` to determine what to show to the user. 

### Tags 

#### ab
This tag sets an A/B test for the given handle. It will randomly choose a experiment variant, record a hit and provide the experiment and handle to the content of the tag.

If you want your variant to persist over the session lifetime, set session="true"

```antlers
{{ ab experiment="experiment_handle" session="true" }}
    {{ experiment }} {{ variant }}
{{ /ab }}
```

#### ab:success
This tag marks an A/B test as successful.

```antlers
{{ ab:success experiment="experiment_handle" variant="variant_handle" }}
```

#### ab:failure
This tag marks an A/B test as a failure.

```antlers
{{ ab:failure experiment="experiment_handle" variant="variant_handle" }}
```


### Facade
This package provides a facade for interacting with experiments:
`\Thoughtco\ABTester\Experiment`

#### get an experiment
`$experiment = \Thoughtco\ABTester\Experiment::find('experiment_handle');`

#### get all experiments
`\Thoughtco\ABTester\Experiment::all();`


### Experiment
Once you have an experiment you can record hits, successes, failures and get results.

#### hit
Use this to mark an experiment as being viewed:
`$experiment->recordHit($variantHandle);`

#### success
Use this to mark an experiment as being successful:
`$experiment->recordSuccess($variantHandle);`

#### failure
Use this to mark an experiment as being a failure:
`$experiment->recordFailure($variantHandle);`
